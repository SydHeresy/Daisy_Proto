First attempt at designing a PCB from hacked togehter schematics... What could go wrong?

NOTE: THIS DESIGN IS UNTESTED!!!
I will test it soon and update the files. 


Sep-15 2022 Changes
Added DC/DC power block and opAmps for audio input. 
Redesigned PCB completely moving all components to one side so that it can lay flat.
